# FScript

Allows easily making minecraft scriptable

This was mostly made for /sfort/MC-SurvivalFlight,
ergo it doesn't implement features that don't make sense for it.
despite that it easy to extend and apply to any other mod,
still it is in development; complete recodes are likely-ish
so when using it consider taking note / versioning the script
