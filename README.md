# FScript

Allows easily making minecraft scriptable

This was mostly made for [SurvivalFlight](https://github.com/sfort/MC-SurvivalFlight),  
ergo it doesn't implement features that don't make sense for it.  
despite that it easy to extend and apply to any other mod,  
still it is in development; complete recodes are likely-ish  
so when using it consider taking note / versioning the script
